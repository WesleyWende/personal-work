    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <P><strong>
        Wes dynamic automobile was inspired by the love the founder had for car. At times people said he obsessed with cars so to the extent he was the one choosing what car people around him was to buy based on the durability, availability and affordibility of parts. The first car he ever drove was a Toyota 4runner SR5 1998 model. with that car he understood most of the difficulties of cars cause there was no problem that car didn't go through. It flipped five times on a highway road but still got up and move on.
